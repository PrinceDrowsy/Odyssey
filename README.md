# Odyssey

A quest mod to make your adventures Epic.

Odyssey is a modular quest system intended to be usable by both developers and gamers alike. I hope to provide a grand experience with this mod while being relatively non-taxing in what system resources it requires. I also intend for this to be as widely compatible with other mods as possible. However, it is because of this goal that I greatly appreciate any and all willing to let me know of anything I should work on in that regard. Testers and bug catchers are the cornerstone of any great mod.

This is my first mod, and understandably a very ambitious one. Please have mercy on my soul for my hubris, I'm hoping to take this one baby step at a time. If I fall from grace and give up, you have full permission to make fun of me for it, just please wait for the white flag before you aim for my Achilles' heel is all I ask, haha. 

# Features

 - A modular quest system where you can select base templates or create your own regarding what quests are given, what entities they're given through, and the effects they have on factions (i.e. will villagers or monsters run in fear should you gain a level of notoriety? Will you be rewarded with emeralds or ender pearls? etc.)
 - Utilizes a datapack-like structure for implementing and sharing custom questlines, intended to be easy to use for those who've never coded in their lives.
 - An optional base questline to play, heavily inspired by Homer's epics. (Homer's specifically. Do not speak of the Telegony to me.)
 - Gameplay that still feels like it belongs in Minecraft.
 - Relatively lightweight in performance cost.
 - Eventual quest implementation compatibility with as many additional modded systems as possible (Such as Unicopia or Bewitchment's magic systems, Origin's playable races, survival mods that implement things like temperature and thirst, etc.)
