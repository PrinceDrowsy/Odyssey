# Odyssey

A quest mod to make your adventures Epic.

Odyssey adds a base questline of its own based on the famous tales by Homer, as well as providing a system for other modders to add on questlines of their own with. I hope to provide a grand experience with this mod while being relatively non-taxing in what system resources it requires. I also intend for this to be as widely compatible with other mods as possible, hence the use of the Quilt mod loader.

I will not be porting Odyssey to other mod loaders, as Quilt is practically compatible with everything, functions fantastically, and is my personal favorite mod loader as of this moment. You are more than welcome to make ports for Odyssey if you credit me properly, but in the best case scenario you will hopefully not have to in order to use it. Unless you're just as passionate about another mod loader as I am about Quilt, which is understandable.
