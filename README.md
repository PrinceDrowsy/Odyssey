# Odyssey

A quest mod to make your adventures Epic.

Odyssey adds a base questline of its own based on the famous tales by Homer, as well as providing a system for other modders to add on questlines of their own with. I hope to provide a grand experience with this mod while being relatively non-taxing in what system resources it requires. I also intend for this to be as widely compatible with other mods as possible, hence the use of the Quilt mod loader. However, it is because of this goal that I greatly appreciate any and all willing to let me know of anything I should work on in that regard. Testers and bug catchers are the cornerstone of any great mod.

I will not be porting Odyssey to other mod loaders, as I have high hopes for Quilt's compatibility with mods for other loaders. You are more than welcome to make ports for Odyssey if you credit me properly, but in the best case scenario you will hopefully not have to in order to use it. Unless you're just as passionate about another mod loader as I am about Quilt, which is understandable as my love for the modding community is for the passions of its creators.

This is my first mod, and understandably a very ambitious one. Please have mercy on my soul for my hubris, I'm hoping to take this one baby step at a time. If I fall from grace and give up, you have full permission to make fun of me for it, just please wait for the white flag before you aim for my Achilles' heel is all I ask, haha. 

# Features

 - A base questline to play, heavily inspired by Homer's epics. (Homer's specifically. Do not speak of the Telegony to me.)

 - A relatively lightweight system for modders to add questlines of their own with.
 - Compatibility and eventually additional quests for other mods you play with.
